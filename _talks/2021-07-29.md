<!-- It is known that every surface-link, which is a closed surface embedded in $4$-space, can be described as the closure of a $2$-dimensional braid providing it is orientable. In this talk, we introduce a new method of describing a surface-link using a braided surface, which we call a plat form. We prove that every surface-link, not necessarily orientable, can be described in a plat form. The plat index for a surface-link is defined. In classical knot theory, the plat index of a link coincides with the bridge index. The plat index of a surface-link we introduce here is an analogy of them. -->
