<!-- A plat form for links is a presentation of a classical link using a geometric braid. In this talk, we introduce a plat form for surface-links which is a presentation of a surface-link using a braided surface. Our method can be applied to any surface-link, which is not necessarily orientable. We show how to obtain the surface-link group from the braided surface group by adding some simple relations. -->
