<!-- A plat form for links is a presentation of a classical link using a braid. We can apply this presentation to surface-links, using a braided surface instead of a braid, and prove that every surface-link has a plat form presentation. In this talk, we show how to compute the knot group and the symmetric fundamental quandle of a surface-link using a plat form. -->
