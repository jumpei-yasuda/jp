A plat form for links is a presentation of classical links using braids, and this is another aspect of the bridge decomposition for links. In this talk, we introduce a method of presenting surface links using braided surfaces, which we call plat forms. Our method can be applied to not only orientable surface links, but also non-orientable  surface links.
